  		-I have learned how to more clearly articulate my html structure using a tree-diagram, as well as better resources for looking up HTML reference.
  		-How to read markup language.
  		-I have had a moderate level of familiarity with HTML, so it has all been decently easy so far.
  		-Organizing my local directory with all of these file downloads has been the most challenging ;)
  		-The Mozilla MDN forums are definitely beneficial for research. I also set up an organization strategy to help me not get confused by all the `index.html`s
